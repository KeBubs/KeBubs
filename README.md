### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My names Kieran! I'm relatively new to coding. I started learning some Python bsack in February and it took off from there!

Im starting a new journey with the School of Code! I'll be documenting my work here. See you soon ðŸ˜Ž

Sunday 10th September: Reflections on the first week of SoC BootCamp:
The week started un understaing how to solve problems by utilising Computational Thinking, understanding this method has helped me as i progressed through the week when i was introduced to GitHub and Git. 
Reflections: Using Git, multiple flags and commands are required. The basics are:
- Git add (essentially selecting which file you are wanting to send over to GitHub)
- Git commit -m . : commit is effectively taking a snapshot of the work completed so far, followed by a message describing the changes you have made.
- git push : this is where the files are then shared back to the remote location, so others can access it.

During the week, we also looked at using flow diagrams to strategise amongst a team as well as using the "Agile" methodology to plan and execute the flow diagram in the form of sprints, meetings etc. 

Final part of the week was taking our flow diagram and putting into practice what we had learnt in the week to make a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in the form of an escape room.
