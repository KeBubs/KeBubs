### Hi there üëã

My names Kieran! I'm relatively new to coding. I started learning some Python back in February and it took off from there!
Since February, I have completed multiple Certifications in Python (which can be seen attached to my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-busby-7b519b12a) which led my interest further into code, eventually leading to applying for a position at School of Code (SoC), also off of a referral from a good friend and co-worker. 

I've now started my journey with School of Code and I'll be documenting my work here. üòé

Over the next coming ~16 weeks, i'll be attaching some of my projects onto my page and documenting my progress with the SoC as a way to monitor my progression, any feedback along the way is much appreciated!

Week 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub ü§Ø, Computational Thinking, When to use AI, Flow Diagrams, Agile Methodology and much more.
The basics of Git control are somewhat sussed out now, using git add, clone, merge, changing branches, however still a lot to cover. I've download the e-book copy of Pro Git, the second edition created by the founders of Git. You can find it here - https://books.apple.com/gb/book/pro-git/id949361544.
AI has also proved a useful tool for de-bugging, structuring code and also finding ways to make my code more efficient/cleaner!
A useful tool which can be found online as well as an extension in VS Code - drawio. Where you can add your flow diagram straight into a repo!

Week 2: Introduction to JavaScript üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
With somewhat a previous understanding of Python from earlier completed courses on Coursera.org; some of the syntax and code felt very similar when starting JavaScript. Though I need to get used to adding ';' to the end of my lines...
Using JavaScript in workshops led to creating a very basic, Rock Paper Scissor Game with my two SoC partners Andy and Alexandra.
