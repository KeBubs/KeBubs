### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My names Kieran! I started learning some Python back in February and it took off from there!
Since February, I have completed multiple Certifications in Python (which can be seen attached to my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-busby-7b519b12a).

During September 2023 - December 2023; I underwent a 16 week remote web development boot-camp, the School of Code. Throughout this immensive course, I have gained a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and acquired specialized expertise in full-stack development. 

During the final four weeks of the boot-camp, myself and my 5 team-mates worked on our project, BeyondBarriers - a centralized WebApp where users can view important accessibility information about a venue, helping them to make informed decisions on whether the venue is suitable for their needs. -> https://beyond-barriers.vercel.app

Outside of the coding world, I play video games on my gaming PC which I built not too long ago, coach an 11 a-side football team, get handya round the house with DIY jobs (including landscaping my whole garden!) and spending time with my daughter.

My GitHub will mostly be personal projects, to try and make some nuances of day to day life that little bit easier, such as my current project which helps me personally; randomising a football club into evenly distributed teams, but considering players positions and influence in games, in order to make the teams fairer.

My coding journey is ever changing, I love learning new frameworks and technologies, putting them into practice in my own projects to refine my skillset ðŸ™‚
