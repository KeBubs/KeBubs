### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My names Kieran! I'm relatively new to coding. I started learning some Python back in February and it took off from there!
Since February, I have completed multiple Certifications in Python (which can be seen attached to my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-busby-7b519b12a).

During September 2023 - December 2023; I underwent a 16 week remote web development boot-camp, the School of Code. Throughout this immensive course, I have gained a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and acquired specialized expertise in full-stack development. 

Outside of the coding world, I play video games on my gaming PC which I built not too long ago, coach an 11 a-side football teamm as well as sometimes play & cook HelloFresh meals with my 4 year old daughter!

My GitHub will mostly be personal projects, to try and make some nuances of day to day life that little bit easier, such as my current project which helps me personally; randomising a football club into evenly distributed teams, but considering players positions and influence in games, in order to make the teams fairer. 

              **Tech Stack, inlcuding but not limited to**
Front End:
- Next.js, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
